# stacks

built out a Stack class that can:

• add a new item to the top via a .push() method <br>
• remove an item from the top and returns its value with a .pop() method <br>
• return the value of the top item using a .peek() method <br>
• allow a stack instance to maintain an awareness of its size to prevent stack overflow.
